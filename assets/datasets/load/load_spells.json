After the spell is cast, which requires three consecutive tricks if in combat, the target rolls a Magic roll against your Magic roll to resist. If he fails, he is forced into a new shape. He retains his mind: Reason, Heart, Magic, and Charisma scores, Inspirations, Mood, plus histories and skills (although he may not be able to use them in his new form). His other attributes are those of the new form: Strength, Quickness, and Body.\nThe shape of the cursed target depends on the caster's wereshape, although substitutions are possible if the group and GM see fit.\nThe victim gains a new Magic roll to break the spell, opposed by your Magic roll, each fortnight for one season. During this time, the spell counts as your bound high spell. After this, the curse becomes permanent and does not count as a bound high spell.\nThere is, however, always a condition that breaks the curse, set by the caster at the time of casting: a kiss from a princess, the true love of a troll, the throne falls and shatters, etc. Note that because the cursed victim retains his Inspirations, killing him may be difficult, even in the cursed animal shape."

He suffers a Reason penalty die on every roll in the first round and last rounds of every encounter as he looks over his shoulder.\n6 - Idiot Savant - The character's Reason is reduced to 2 in all but one field, where his Reason is 12.

When you cast this spell, over the course of half a minute, you transform into one of these were-beasts (counts as five consecutive Tricks in combat). Your Reason, Heart, Magic, Charisma, Mood, Inspirations, and Histories remain your own, but you gain the Strength, Quickness, Body, Armor and Weapon Quality, shape, and fighting styles of the were-beast, with two exceptions. First, no characteristic can be raised higher than your number of magic levels. For example, if you are a wizard 6/ assassin 6 and you shapechange into a werebear, your Strength and Body are 6 rather than the 10 and 9 normally listed for a were-bear. Second, you gain fighting styles only at the apprentice level, even if the werebeast normally has mastered the fighting style. You may also gain other special abilities; these are noted in the were-beast's description. Unless noted, you do not gain other were-beast abilities, such as being proof against all but silver weapons.\nYou can remain in wereshape for up to one day per magic level per lunar cycle, retaking your original shape over the course of another half a minute.\nFor example, if you are a wizard/chosen one 5/3, and your chosen one levels are magic levels, then you can remain in your wereshape for 8 days per month.\nCarried items, including clothing, do not change form with you. Wounds do. That is, if you have suffered 4 points of Body damage in your human form, and then you shift into your wereform, you will still have 4 points of Body damage.\nCasting close spells is possible but difficult in wereshape; you must roll your Magic score against the Doom to have a chance at success. Casting spells in combat and casting high spells at any time while in wereshape is impossible."
