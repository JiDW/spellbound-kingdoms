    "description": "No fighting style emphasizes the mind and the soul as much as Five Seasons does. Learning Free Sword or Great Weapon or Arrowheart, the young warrior practices move after combat move, learns footwork, strengthens his body, hones his quickness. The Five Seasons novice does those things, too, but he is equally likely to train by drinking ixsinthe with his grandfather, listening to the music in the cold snow outside an abandoned concert hall for a day and a night, or attempting to walk across rice paper without tearing it. As such, any fighter using the Five Seasons style gains a bonus Reason defense die whenever anyone attacks his Mood.",
