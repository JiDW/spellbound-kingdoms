Of course, sages say the same of the Language of Stars style, so the two are perhaps a perfect match. This spell summons the astral homunculus of a descent cat; the homculus's stats are those of a wolf (p. 200). If you fail the Charisma roll to control the homunculus, the cat is disoriented, enraged, and attacks you. If you succeed, the cat works for you and fights for you for twelve minutes. The same cat's homunculus returns each time (fading away, painfully, instead of truly dying, if severely injured), so it can be trained though never domesticated."

The GM is free, naturally, to award larger bonuses for more detailed prophecies. Dueling players, or players in groups haunted by mistrust, may elect to write prophecies on scrap paper, revealing them after the round in question. Any player not made aware of the prophecy does not receive the Mood bonus should it come true. Whispers in Starlight can communicate prophecies while maintaining their secrecy.
