    "description": "This style is designed for a quick transition from drinking wine with your target to stabbing him in the eye, or from rolling in the sheets with him to rolling him into his grave. To put it another way, once you have the information, you fade into the shadows, there's a flash of blade, and your work is done. Nonetheless, complications do arise, and so this has become a full-fledged fighting style for spies, courtesans, and anyone else who expects to be fighting in bedchambers and porticos with a glass of wine in one hand and a dagger in the other. Its roots being what they are, however, this style suffers against armor of superior quality. Its popularity despite this shortcoming is a testament to its overall effectiveness and the enduring appeal of the Duck and Slip maneuver.",
