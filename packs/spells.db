The curse wears down the target's maximum Mood cumulatively, 1 point per scene (or day) and, if you wish, it also wears down one other characteristic of your choice, cumulatively, also by 1 in every scene. The curse continues until the target is disabled or dead, until you break the spell, or until the ashes of the doll used to cast the spell are purified (usually with a salve doll or heap loa salve spell). The curse attacks with your Magic die; if the target wins the initial roll, the curse is resisted. A curse that is not resisted attacks anew each day. If the target fails the initial roll but wins a subsequent roll, he is still cursed but does not take damage in that scene (or day). If the target of the curse has wronged you, then should you wish it, your curse outlasts the target's (and your) death, moving on to plague his heir or another person in his house, and from there to another person, one at a time without mercy, until the house is no more.","type":"close"},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"99ZnDWtH2QTzrxxi":3},"flags":{}}
